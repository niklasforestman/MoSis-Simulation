MoSi Coronavirus Simulation
Authors: KT MoSi (Albrecht Pohl, Niklas Waldmann)

The simulation does not represent a scientific model of the coronavirus spread. However, basic influences as the division of areas,
vaccination, contact restrictions and immunity can be seen and reproduced. Parameters are used to tweak the progression.
The model is based on the SIR-model, combined with additional stages. The progression can be tracked live and is
predicted using a parameter fit. After the simulation is completed, the process can be saved and analyzed via an onboard
Excel tool and an interactive chart.
